Final comments- yes I had plenty more time to work on this project. Yes I could have completed another 100 hours to get this done. But I decided that this is not enough portion of my grade to sit trying to figure this out. This doesn't mean that I wasnt still working on class material. I found 3 very interesting books that I am now about halfway through on php, css3 and javascript (which I am still weak weak weak on).
